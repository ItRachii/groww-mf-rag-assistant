The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit\nrisk through in-house credit analysis.\n\n- **Prepayment Risk:** Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its\n\nsecurities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates.

Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of\nthe scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher\nimpact cost when such instruments are sold.\n\n  - **Credit Risk:** The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the\n\ncombined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the\nissuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The\nweakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure\ndue to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce\nguarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases\nthe overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions.

Additionally,\nto address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral\ndue to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the\nrepo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for\nreplacement of security with eligible security.

Other risks\ninclude, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate\nperfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices.\n\n- Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well\nas disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the\nability of the fund manager to identify such opportunities.

While there are\nno regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds\nas per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is\nno fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below:\n\n**Key Risk Factors:**\n\n**-** **Risk on coupon servicing**\n\n**Banks**\n\nAs per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel\ndistributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable\nreserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow\nbanks to make payment of coupons.\n\n**NBFCs**\n\nWhile NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can\nalso be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of\ncapital ratios.\n\n**Corporates**",

However, the coupon\nis usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon\nrate of the PDI.\n\n**-** **Risk of write-down or conversion into equity**\n\n**Banks**\n\nAs per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity\nTier-1 (CET-1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get\nwritten down. Further, AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common\nequity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV\nis a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non-viable unless\nthere is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection\nhappens.

Later, the short seller buys back the\nstock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects,\nShort seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the\ndifference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock\nappreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money\nand these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall\nresult into major losses in the portfolio.\n\n\n**(xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:**\n\n- **Price Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a\ndaily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in\ngeneral market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and\nInfrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer\nprocedures.\n\n- **Interest Rate Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates\nrise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n\n- **Credit Risk:**\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest\npayment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of\nREITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not\nnecessarily be pre scheduled.\n\n- **Liquidity Risk:**\n\n\n**14**\n\n\nHDFC Balanced Advantage Fund - KIM",

Investment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest\nrates and their outlook.\n\nThe Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification and\nsubject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time.",

Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would\nincorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio construction process. The risk control\nprocess involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this\ndiversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use\nvarious derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time,\nwith an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest. While these measures\nare expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would\nbe completely eliminated.\n\n**PORTFOLIO TURNOVER**\n\n\nThe Scheme is an open-ended Scheme. It is expected that there would be a number of subscriptions and\nredemptions on a daily basis.

Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and\ninvestors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks.\n\n- Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a\n\nlarger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment\nin such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.\n\n\n\n\n- While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these\n\ninvestments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the\nScheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold.",

The NAV of the Scheme\nis expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase\nin the level of interest rates.\n\n- Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may\n\nrestrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security\nis finally sold.\n\n- Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of\n\nthe issuers.\n\n- Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of\n\nan issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which\nmay have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in\neconomic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions\nspecific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit\nquality and security values.

The possibility of such prepayment\nmay force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields,\nresulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n\n- **Reinvestment Risk:** This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the\n\n\n\nsecurities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on\n\n\n\n**32**\n\n\n\nHDFC Balanced Advantage Fund-SID\n\n\ninterest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be\nlower than that originally assumed.\n\n  - **Settlement risk:** Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and\n\nsuch periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems\nin settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are\nuninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities\npurchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment\nopportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the\nabsence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in\npotential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in\nthe Scheme's portfolio.\n\n  - Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income",

Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest\nrates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing\ncoupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of\ninterest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels\nat which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government\nSecurities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the\nsense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by\nmovement in interest rates in the financial system.\n\n  - Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme\n\nInformation Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may\nincrease or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level\nof risk than Government securities.

Zero\ncoupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic\npayment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current\ninterest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values.

Hence,\nlower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments\nand generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold.\n\n  - **Credit Risk:** The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength\n\nof the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could\nhave an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to\ninability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the\nunderlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk\nof servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions.

The repurchase price should be greater than the original sale price,\nthe difference effectively representing interest. A repo in corporate debt securities is economically similar to\na secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt securities as collateral to protect against default.\nSome of the risks associated with repo in corporate debt are given below:\n**Counterparty Risk:** Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back\nsecurities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter (OTC) repo trades, the\ninvestment manager will endeavour to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with counterparties having\nstrong credit profiles. Also, the counter-party risk is to an extent mitigated by taking collateral equivalent in\nvalue to the transaction after knocking off a minimum haircut on the intrinsic value of the collateral. In the\nevent of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate debt securities.\nIn case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may\nalso provide settlement guarantee.\n**Collateral Risk:** Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet the repo\nobligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in corporate\ndebt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to reduction\nin market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract\ncan incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum\nhaircut requirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security.

Generally, when interest rates rise,\nprices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n\n- **Credit Risk:**\n\n\n**39**\n\n\nHDFC Balanced Advantage Fund-SID\n\n\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or\neven on paying back the principal amount on maturity.

Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs),\nthe proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling\nhis loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the maturity of the\nunderlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from borrowers.

Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree\nof risk and investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the\nrisks.\n\n  - Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature\n\nand carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the\nexchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.\n\n  - While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to\n\nsell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and\nmay lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold.\n\n  - Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the\n\ninvestments held in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal\ncircumstances.\n\n\n**(ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities**\n\n\n\n\n- The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money",

The\nNAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be\nadversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates.\n\n- Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market,\n\nwhich may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring\nlosses till the security is finally sold.\n\n- Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term\n\nrating of the issuers.\n\n- Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e.\n\nthe risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or\nany other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial\nconditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes\nin economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that\nmay have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may\nincrease the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit\nrisk through in-house credit analysis.\n\n- **Prepayment Risk:** Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its\n\nsecurities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of\nsuch prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in\nsecurities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n\n- **Reinvestment Risk:** This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received",

Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations\nthat do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a\nspecified date when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are\ngenerally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the\ntime remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It\nalso varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the\nperceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are\ngenerally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.\n\n**(iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities:**\n\n\n\n\n- Except for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in\n\nsecurities which are not listed on a stock exchange (“unlisted Securities”) which in general\nare subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are\ntraded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and\nthere can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted\nsecurities at a fair value.\n\n\n**7**\n\n\nHDFC Balanced Advantage Fund - KIM\n\n\n  - Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value",

Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due\nto the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities,\nthe liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar\nrated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of\nthe scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher\nimpact cost when such instruments are sold.\n\n  - **Credit Risk:** The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the\n\ncombined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the\nissuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The\nweakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure\ndue to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce\nguarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases\nthe overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions.

This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo\ntransactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally,\nto address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral\ndue to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the\nrepo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for\nreplacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a\nhigher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the\nilliquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction\ndue to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by\nconsidering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut.

However, the coupon\nis usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon\nrate of the PDI.\n\n**-** **Risk of write-down or conversion into equity**\n\n**Banks**\n\nAs per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity\nTier-1 (CET-1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get\nwritten down. Further, AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common\nequity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV\nis a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non-viable unless\nthere is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection\nhappens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital.\nThis risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates.\n\n**-** **Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer**\n\n\n**13**\n\n\nHDFC Balanced Advantage Fund - KIM\n\n\n**Banks**\n\nThe issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified\nperiod from the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines.

Later, the short seller buys back the\nstock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects,\nShort seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the\ndifference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock\nappreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money\nand these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall\nresult into major losses in the portfolio.\n\n\n**(xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:**\n\n- **Price Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a\ndaily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in\ngeneral market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and\nInfrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer\nprocedures.\n\n- **Interest Rate Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates\nrise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n\n- **Credit Risk:**\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest\npayment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of\nREITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not\nnecessarily be pre scheduled.\n\n- **Liquidity Risk:**\n\n\n**14**\n\n\nHDFC Balanced Advantage Fund - KIM",

    "text": "- **Liquidity Risk:**\n\n\n**14**\n\n\nHDFC Balanced Advantage Fund - KIM\n\n\nThis refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is\nno assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there\nwould be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of\nilliquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments\nfor which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be\nexposed to liquidity risk.\n\n- **Reinvestment Risk:**\nInvestments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there\ncould be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay-outs,\netc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns.\n\n- **Legal and Regulatory Risk**\nThe regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs\ncomprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and\nenforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast\nas to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers\nof REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the\nregulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply\nwith the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions.\n\n\n**(xiv) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes**\n\n1.

As NIFTY 50 TRI data is not available since inception of the scheme, additional\nbenchmark performance is calculated using composite CAGR of NIFTY 50 PRI values from February 1, 1994 to June 29, 1999 and TRI values since June 30, 1999.

The expenses of the Direct Plan under the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the\ndistribution expenses / commission charged in the Regular Plan. N.A.: Not Available.

    "text": "**Though every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the**\n**AMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved.**\n**No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme.**\n\n\n**Risk Control**\nInvestments made by the Scheme would be in accordance with the investment objectives of the scheme and\nprovisions of SEBI (MF) Regulations. Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would\nincorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio construction process. The risk control\nprocess involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this\ndiversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use\nvarious derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time,\nwith an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest. While these measures\nare expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would\nbe completely eliminated.\n\n**PORTFOLIO TURNOVER**\n\n\nThe Scheme is an open-ended Scheme. It is expected that there would be a number of subscriptions and\nredemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable measure of\naccuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage and\ntransaction cost.\n\n\n**D.** **HOW** **WILL** **THE** **SCHEME** **BENCHMARK** **ITS** **PERFORMANCE?**\n**NIFTY 50 Hybrid Composite Debt 50:50 Index (TRI)**\n\nAs required under clause 1.9 of Master Circular, the benchmark has been selected from amongst those\nnotified by AMFI as the first tier benchmark to be adopted by mutual funds and which are reflective of the\ncategory of the scheme.\n\n\n**14**\n\n\nHDFC Balanced Advantage Fund-SID",

Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and\ninvestors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks.\n\n- Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a\n\nlarger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment\nin such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.\n\n\n\n\n- While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these\n\ninvestments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the\nScheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold.",

The NAV of the Scheme\nis expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase\nin the level of interest rates.\n\n- Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may\n\nrestrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security\nis finally sold.\n\n- Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of\n\nthe issuers.\n\n- Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of\n\nan issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which\nmay have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in\neconomic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions\nspecific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit\nquality and security values.

Delays or other problems\nin settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are\nuninvested and no return is earned thereon.

Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest\nrates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing\ncoupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of\ninterest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels\nat which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government\nSecurities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the\nsense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by\nmovement in interest rates in the financial system.\n\n  - Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme\n\nInformation Document carry different levels and types of risk.

Zero\ncoupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic\npayment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current\ninterest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values.

In case of over the counter (OTC) repo trades, the\ninvestment manager will endeavour to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with counterparties having\nstrong credit profiles.

This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in corporate\ndebt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to reduction\nin market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract\ncan incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum\nhaircut requirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security.

Further,\nAT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in\nthe event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank\nis deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds\nor a public sector capital injection happens.

Instead, he\nborrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and\nreturns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock\nback for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price\nand the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss.

Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs),\nthe proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator.

The size of the credit enhancement as\nindicated by rating agency depends on the originator's track record, past delinquencies, pattern of the\nportfolio & characteristics of the pool vis-a-vis of the portfolio, nature of the asset class.\n\n  - **Ability to pay**\nThe quality of the origination impacts the performance of the underlying asset & thus originators with\nstrong systems and processes in place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management\nsystem of the originator and availability of MIS reports on timely basis, results in creation of strong\nasset portfolio.\n\n  - **Business Risk Assessment**\nThe business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit\nassessment wherein following factors are also considered:",

Later, the short seller buys back the\nstock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects,\nShort seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the\ndifference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock\nappreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money\nand these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall\nresult into major losses in the portfolio.\n\n\n**(xii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:**\n\n - **Price Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a\ndaily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in\ngeneral market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and\nInfrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer\nprocedures.\n\n - **Interest Rate Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates\nrise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n\n - **Credit Risk:**\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest\npayment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of\nREITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not\nnecessarily be pre scheduled.",

In the\nevent of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate\ndebt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by\nRBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee.\n**Collateral Risk:** Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate\nto meet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in\nrepo transactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team.\nAdditionally, to address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt\nsecurity held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate\neither an early termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the\nminimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security.\nMoreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security",

In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole\ndiscretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under certain\ncircumstances, as described under **section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend**\n**Redemption of the units.**\n\n- At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be\n\nable to invest in securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies\ncollected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities /\ninvestments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The\nScheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity\nrequirements.\n\n- Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance\n\nbetween the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to\nmedium term period.\n\n- Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments,\n\nwhich may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation\npolicies.",

Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would\nincorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio construction process. The risk control\nprocess involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this\ndiversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use\nvarious derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time,\nwith an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest.

Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable\nmeasure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage\nand transaction cost.",

The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities\npurchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment\nopportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the\nabsence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in\npotential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in\nthe Scheme's portfolio.\n\n- Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income\n\nsecurity. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest\nrates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing\ncoupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of\ninterest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels\nat which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government\nSecurities. It exists for all fixed income securities.

Zero\ncoupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic\npayment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current\ninterest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values.

Further,\nAT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in\nthe event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank\nis deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds\nor a public sector capital injection happens.

Instead, he\nborrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and\nreturns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock\nback for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price\nand the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short\npositions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price\nincreases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio.\n\n\n**(xii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:**\n\n\n**30**\n\n\nHDFC ELSS Tax Saver-SID\n\n\n- **Price Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis\nowing to market movements.

Generally, when interest rates rise,\nprices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n\n- **Credit Risk:**\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or\neven on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are\nlikely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled.",

This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions\nonly in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the\nrisk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit\nrating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement\nor call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security\nwith eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying\nsecurity than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on\nthe underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the\nadequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by considering the daily market value &\napplying the prescribed haircut.

This shall aid in managing volatility and also improve liquidity.\n\n- Any investments in debt securities would be undertaken after assessing the associated credit risk,\n\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk.\n\n\n\n**Credit Evaluation Policy**\n\nThe credit evaluation policy of the AMC entails evaluation of credit fundamentals of each investment\nopportunity. Some of the factors that are evaluated inter-alia may include outlook on the sector, parentage,\nquality of management, and overall financial strength of the credit. The AMC utilises ratings of recognized\nrating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually\nin instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency.\n\nIn line with clause 12.12 of Master Circular, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for\ninvestments in unrated instruments.

While government bonds, money market\ninstruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other\ninstruments typically face higher liquidity risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid\ncompared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity risk\nbased on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are creating\nportfolios that are diversified across maturities, ratings, types of securities, etc. in line with the fund\nobjectives, regulations and investment strategy.\n\n**Credit Risk:** Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence,\n\ncredit risk faced by different schemes will be different based on the underlying portfolio / investment\nstrategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be\nundertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors\n(parentage, track record etc.). Each of the scheme/portfolio will endeavour to maintain adequate\ndiversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations and investment\nstrategy. Unrated investments, if any, would require specific approval from a committee constituted for\nthe purpose.\n\n**Debt Derivatives Risk:** The AMC has provision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing\n\nand hedging purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter parties under pre\napproved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision\nclauses will be provided as per standard practice on a reciprocal basis. Interest Rate Swaps and other\nderivative instruments will be used as per local (RBI and SEBI) regulatory guidelines.",

Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs),\nthe proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling\nhis loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the maturity of the\nunderlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from borrowers.

Later, the short seller buys back the\nstock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects,\nShort seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the\ndifference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock\nappreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money\nand these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall\nresult into major losses in the portfolio.\n\n\n**(xii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:**\n\n - **Price Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a\ndaily basis owing to market movements.

Generally, when interest rates\nrise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n\n - **Credit Risk:**\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest\npayment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of\nREITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not\nnecessarily be pre scheduled.",

In the\nevent of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate\ndebt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by\nRBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee.\n**Collateral Risk:** Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate\nto meet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in\nrepo transactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team.\nAdditionally, to address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt\nsecurity held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate\neither an early termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the\nminimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security.\nMoreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security",

In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole\ndiscretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under certain\ncircumstances, as described under **section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend**\n**Redemption of the units.**\n\n- At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be\n\nable to invest in securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies\ncollected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities /\ninvestments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The\nScheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity\nrequirements.\n\n- Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance\n\nbetween the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to\nmedium term period.\n\n- Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments,\n\nwhich may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation\npolicies.",

Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would\nincorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio construction process. The risk control\nprocess involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this\ndiversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use\nvarious derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time,\nwith an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest.

Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable\nmeasure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage\nand transaction cost.",

The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities\npurchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment\nopportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the\nabsence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in\npotential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in\nthe Scheme's portfolio.\n\n- Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income\n\nsecurity. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest\nrates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing\ncoupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of\ninterest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels\nat which the market is already dealing in existing securities.

Further,\nAT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in\nthe event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank\nis deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds\nor a public sector capital injection happens.

Instead, he\nborrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and\nreturns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock\nback for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price\nand the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss.

Generally, when interest rates rise,\nprices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n\n- **Credit Risk:**\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or\neven on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are\nlikely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled.",

This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions\nonly in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the\nrisk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit\nrating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement\nor call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security\nwith eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying\nsecurity than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on\nthe underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the\nadequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by considering the daily market value &\napplying the prescribed haircut.

This shall aid in managing volatility and also improve liquidity.\n\n- Any investments in debt securities would be undertaken after assessing the associated credit risk,\n\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk.\n\n\n\n**Credit Evaluation Policy**\n\nThe credit evaluation policy of the AMC entails evaluation of credit fundamentals of each investment\nopportunity. Some of the factors that are evaluated inter-alia may include outlook on the sector, parentage,\nquality of management, and overall financial strength of the credit. The AMC utilises ratings of recognized\nrating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually\nin instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency.\n\nIn line with clause 12.12 of Master Circular, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for\ninvestments in unrated instruments.

While government bonds, money market\ninstruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other\ninstruments typically face higher liquidity risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid\ncompared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity risk\nbased on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are creating\nportfolios that are diversified across maturities, ratings, types of securities, etc. in line with the fund\nobjectives, regulations and investment strategy.\n\n**Credit Risk:** Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence,\n\ncredit risk faced by different schemes will be different based on the underlying portfolio / investment\nstrategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be\nundertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors\n(parentage, track record etc.). Each of the scheme/portfolio will endeavour to maintain adequate\ndiversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations and investment\nstrategy. Unrated investments, if any, would require specific approval from a committee constituted for\nthe purpose.\n\n**Debt Derivatives Risk:** The AMC has provision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing\n\nand hedging purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter parties under pre\napproved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision\nclauses will be provided as per standard practice on a reciprocal basis. Interest Rate Swaps and other\nderivative instruments will be used as per local (RBI and SEBI) regulatory guidelines.",

Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs),\nthe proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator.

The\nNAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be\nadversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates.\n\n- Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market,\n\nwhich may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring\nlosses till the security is finally sold.\n\n- Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term\n\nrating of the issuers.\n\n- Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e.\n\nthe risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or\nany other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial\nconditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes\nin economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that\nmay have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may\nincrease the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit\nrisk through in-house credit analysis.\n\n- **Prepayment Risk:** Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its\n\nsecurities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of\nsuch prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in\nsecurities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n\n- **Reinvestment Risk:** This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received",

This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo\ntransactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally,\nto address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral\ndue to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the\nrepo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for\nreplacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a\nhigher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the\nilliquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction\ndue to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by\nconsidering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut.

For exposure limits to derivatives, refer section ‘ **Where**\n**will the scheme invest’ under Section II, Part II, Clause A**\n\n\n**Though every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the**\n**AMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved.**\n**No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme.**\n\n\n**Risk Control**\nInvestments made by the Scheme would be in accordance with the investment objectives of the scheme and\nprovisions of SEBI (MF) Regulations. Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would\nincorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio construction process. The risk control\nprocess involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this\ndiversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use\nvarious derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time,\nwith an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest. While these measures\nare expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would\nbe completely eliminated.\n\n\n**PORTFOLIO TURNOVER**\n\n\nThe Scheme is an open-ended Scheme. The portfolio is managed from a long term perspective with an\nendeavour to keep portfolio turnover ratio low. However, it is expected that there would be a number of\nsubscriptions and redemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable\nmeasure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage\nand transaction cost.\n\n\n**D.** **HOW** **WILL** **THE** **SCHEME** **BENCHMARK** **ITS** **PERFORMANCE?**\nNIFTY 500 Index (TRI)\n\n\n**14**\n\n\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID",

Zero\ncoupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic\npayment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current\ninterest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values.

This could limit the\nability of the investor to resell them.\n\n- **Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk**\nThe Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates\nrepresent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation\nof either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and\nOriginator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors'\nRepresentative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the\nCredit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the\namount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent\ndefault of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However,\nmany factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required\nto realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may\nbe lower than the amount due from that Obligor.\n\n- **Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs**\nIn the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge\nOffs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs).\n\n- **Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility**\nIf the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could\nexperience losses or delays in the payments.\n\n- **Risk of Co-mingling**\n\n\n**31**",

However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing\nthe same into the Collection account especially considering that some of the collections may be in the\nform of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from\nother funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors,\nthe Investors may be exposed to a potential loss.\n\n\n**(xii) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI)**\n\nPerpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile.\nSome of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital\nRegulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for\nissuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per guidelines issued by RBI. The\ninstruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated\nwith these instruments are highlighted below:\n\n**Key Risk Factors:**\n\n**-** **Risk on coupon servicing**\n\n**Banks**\n\nAs per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/\npayment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses\nor inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow banks to make payment of\ncoupons.\n\n**NBFCs**",

However, the coupon is usually\ncumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI.\n\n**-** **Risk of write-down or conversion into equity**\n\n**Banks**\n\nAs per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further,\nAT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in\nthe event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank\nis deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds\nor a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector\ninjection of capital.

Instead, he\nborrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and\nreturns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock\nback for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price\nand the lower purchase price). If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short\npositions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price\nincreases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio.\n\n\n**(xiv) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:**\n\n- **Price Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis\nowing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market\nconditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of\ninterest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures.\n\n- **Interest Rate Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise,\nprices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n\n- **Credit Risk:**\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or\neven on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are\nlikely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled.",

This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in corporate\ndebt securities which are approved by credit risk team.

Moreover, the\ninvestment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI\nregulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk\nof price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily\nbasis by considering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut.

The\nNAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be\nadversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates.\n\n- Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market,\n\nwhich may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring\nlosses till the security is finally sold.\n\n- Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term\n\nrating of the issuers.\n\n- Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e.\n\nthe risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or\nany other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial\nconditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes\nin economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that\nmay have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may\nincrease the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit\nrisk through in-house credit analysis.\n\n- **Prepayment Risk:** Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its\n\nsecurities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of\nsuch prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in\nsecurities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n\n- **Reinvestment Risk:** This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received",

Further, AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common\nequity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV\nis a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non-viable unless\nthere is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection\nhappens.

Later, the short seller buys back the\nstock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects,\nShort seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the\ndifference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock\nappreciates, short selling results in loss.

This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo\ntransactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally,\nto address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral\ndue to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the\nrepo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for\nreplacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a\nhigher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the\nilliquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction\ndue to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by\nconsidering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the\nexchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified\nperiod.

For exposure limits to derivatives, refer section ‘ **Where**\n**will the scheme invest’ under Section II, Part II, Clause A**\n\n\n**Though every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the**\n**AMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved.**\n**No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme.**\n\n\n**Risk Control**\nInvestments made by the Scheme would be in accordance with the investment objectives of the scheme and\nprovisions of SEBI (MF) Regulations. Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would\nincorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio construction process. The risk control\nprocess involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this\ndiversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use\nvarious derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time,\nwith an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest. While these measures\nare expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would\nbe completely eliminated.\n\n\n**PORTFOLIO TURNOVER**\n\n\nThe Scheme is an open-ended Scheme. The portfolio is managed from a long term perspective with an\nendeavour to keep portfolio turnover ratio low. However, it is expected that there would be a number of\nsubscriptions and redemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable\nmeasure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage\nand transaction cost.\n\n\n**D.** **HOW** **WILL** **THE** **SCHEME** **BENCHMARK** **ITS** **PERFORMANCE?**\nNIFTY 500 Index (TRI)\n\n\n**14**\n\n\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID",

Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in\neconomic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions\nspecific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit\nquality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will\nendeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis.\n\n- **Prepayment Risk:** Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities\n\nbefore their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment\nmay force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields,\nresulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n\n- **Reinvestment Risk:** This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the\n\nsecurities in the Scheme are reinvested.

The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be\nlower than that originally assumed.\n\n- **Settlement risk:** Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and\n\nsuch periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems\nin settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are\nuninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities\npurchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment\nopportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the\nabsence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in\npotential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in\nthe Scheme's portfolio.\n\n- Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income\n\nsecurity. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest\nrates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing\ncoupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of\ninterest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels\nat which the market is already dealing in existing securities.

Accordingly, the Scheme risk may\nincrease or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level\nof risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are\ncomparatively less risky than AA rated bonds.\n\n- The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated\n\nsecurities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may\nincrease the absolute level of risk of the portfolio.\n\n- As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these\n\nsecurities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk.\nTherefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in\nzero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero\ncoupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic\npayment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current\ninterest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount\ndepends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest.\nIt also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived\ncredit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than\nthe market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.\n\n\n\n**(iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities:**",

Instead, he\nborrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and\nreturns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock\nback for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price\nand the lower purchase price). If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short\npositions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price\nincreases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio.\n\n\n**(xiv) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:**\n\n- **Price Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis\nowing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market\nconditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of\ninterest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures.\n\n- **Interest Rate Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise,\nprices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n\n- **Credit Risk:**\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or\neven on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are\nlikely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled.",

Moreover, the\ninvestment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI\nregulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk\nof price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily\nbasis by considering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut.

Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk\nand investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks.\n\n- Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and\n\ncarry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the\nexchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.\n\n- While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell\n\nthese investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may\nlead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold.\n\n- Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments\n\nheld in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances.\n\n\n\n**(ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities**\n\n\n\n\n- The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money",

The\nNAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be\nadversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates.\n\n- Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market,\n\nwhich may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring\nlosses till the security is finally sold.\n\n- Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term\n\nrating of the issuers.\n\n- Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e.\n\nthe risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or\nany other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial\nconditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes\nin economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that\nmay have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may\nincrease the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit\nrisk through in-house credit analysis.\n\n- **Prepayment Risk:** Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its\n\n\n\nsecurities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of\nsuch prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in\nsecurities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n\n\n\n**6**\n\n\n\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\n\n\n- **Reinvestment Risk:** This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received",

The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which\ngovernment raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already\ndealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government Securities. It\nexists for all fixed income securities.

Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due\nto the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities,\nthe liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar\nrated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of\nthe scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher\nimpact cost when such instruments are sold.\n\n  - **Credit Risk:** The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the\n\ncombined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the\nissuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The\nweakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure\ndue to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce\nguarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases\nthe overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions.

Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the\ncollateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to\nreturn the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits\naccruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary.

These\nCertificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not\nrepresent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any\naffiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate\nHolders against the Investors' Representative.

On persistent default of an Obligor to\nrepay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors\nmay affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required to\nrealise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold\nmay be lower than the amount due from that Obligor.\n\n- **Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs**\nIn the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also,\nany Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates\n(PTCs).\n\n- **Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility**\nIf the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor\ncould experience losses or delays in the payments.",

Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for\nBasel III Capital Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are\nno regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds\nas per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is\nno fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below:\n\n**Key Risk Factors:**\n\n**-** **Risk on coupon servicing**\n\n**Banks**\n\nAs per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel\ndistributions/ payment of coupons.

However, the coupon\nis usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon\nrate of the PDI.\n\n**-** **Risk of write-down or conversion into equity**\n\n**Banks**\n\nAs per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity\nTier-1 (CET-1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get\nwritten down. Further, AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common\nequity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV\nis a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non-viable unless\nthere is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection\nhappens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital.\nThis risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates.\n\n**-** **Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer**\n\n**Banks**\n\nThe issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified\nperiod from the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines.

Later, the short seller buys back the\nstock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects,\nShort seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the\ndifference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock\n\n\n**13**\n\n\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\n\n\nappreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money\nand these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall\nresult into major losses in the portfolio.\n\n\n**(xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:**\n\n- **Price Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a\ndaily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in\ngeneral market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and\nInfrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer\nprocedures.\n\n- **Interest Rate Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates\nrise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n\n- **Credit Risk:**\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest\npayment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of\nREITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not\nnecessarily be pre scheduled.",

    "text": "- **Liquidity Risk:**\nThis refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is\nno assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there\nwould be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of\nilliquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments\nfor which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be\nexposed to liquidity risk.\n\n- **Reinvestment Risk:**\nInvestments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there\ncould be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay-outs,\netc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns.\n\n- **Legal and Regulatory Risk**\nThe regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs\ncomprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and\nenforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast\nas to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers\nof REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the\nregulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply\nwith the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions.\n\n**(xiv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities**\n\nIn repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with\n\nthe seller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than\nthe original sale price, the difference effectively representing interest.

This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo\ntransactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally,\nto address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral\ndue to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the\nrepo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for\nreplacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a\nhigher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the\nilliquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction\ndue to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by\nconsidering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the\nexchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified\nperiod.

However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for restricted purposes as\npermitted by the regulations.\n\nFor detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI.

Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would\nincorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio construction process. The risk control\nprocess involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this\ndiversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use\nvarious derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time,\nwith an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest.

The portfolio is managed from a long term perspective with an\nendeavour to keep portfolio turnover ratio low. However, it is expected that there would be a number of\nsubscriptions and redemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable\nmeasure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage\nand transaction cost.",

Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are\ncomparatively less risky than AA rated bonds.\n\n- The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated\n\nsecurities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may\nincrease the absolute level of risk of the portfolio.\n\n- As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these\n\nsecurities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk.\nTherefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in\nzero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero\ncoupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic\npayment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current\ninterest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount\ndepends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest.\nIt also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived\ncredit risk of the Issuer.

Instead, he\nborrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and\nreturns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock\nback for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price\nand the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short\npositions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price\nincreases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio.\n\n\n**(xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:**\n\n- **Price Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis\nowing to market movements.

Generally, when interest rates rise,\nprices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n\n- **Credit Risk:**\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or\neven on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are\nlikely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled.",

This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in\ncorporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to\nreduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the\nrepo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to\nmeet the minimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security. Moreover,\nthe investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security than required as per\nRBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To\nmitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be\nmonitored on a daily basis by considering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The\nfund manager or the exchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a\nprespecified period.

Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual\ninstrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the coupon step up also compensates the investor\nfor extended holding period.\n\nWhile these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance\nthat these risks would be completely eliminated.\n\n**II.** **INFORMATION** **ABOUT** **THE** **SCHEME:**\n\n\n**37**\n\n\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\n\n\n**A.

Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs),\nthe proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator.

Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from borrowers. Typically,\nthe transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit enhancement (as stipulated by the rating agency\nfor a target rating), which provides protection to investors against defaults by the underlying borrowers.\nGenerally available asset classes for securitisation in India are:\n\n  - Commercial vehicles\n\n  - Auto and two wheeler pools\n\n  - Mortgage pools (residential housing loans)\n\n  - Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans\n\n  - Corporate loans/receivables\n**Investment / Risk Mitigation Strategy**\n**1.

Securitised debt offers additional income (spread) over a debt security of\nsimilar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any additional\ncredit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investment in securitised debt is made to\nmaintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing the overall risk\nprofile of the Scheme.\n\n**2.

Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.\n\n- While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell\n\nthese investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may\nlead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold.\n\n- Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments\n\nheld in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances.\n\n\n\n**(ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities**\n\n\n\n\n- The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money",

The\nNAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be\nadversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates.\n\n- Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market,\n\nwhich may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring\nlosses till the security is finally sold.\n\n- Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term\n\nrating of the issuers.\n\n- Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e.\n\nthe risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or\nany other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial\nconditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes\nin economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that\nmay have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may\nincrease the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit\nrisk through in-house credit analysis.\n\n- **Prepayment Risk:** Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its\n\n\n\nsecurities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of\nsuch prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in\nsecurities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n\n\n\n**6**\n\n\n\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\n\n\n- **Reinvestment Risk:** This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received",

    "text": "- As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the\n\nsecurity, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to\nissuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The\nAMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may\nincrease the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations\nthat do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a\nspecified date when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are\ngenerally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the\ntime remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It\nalso varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the\nperceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are\ngenerally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.\n\n\n\n**(iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities:**\n\nExcept for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in\nsecurities which are not listed on a stock exchange (“unlisted Securities”) which in general\n\n\n**7**\n\n\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\n\n\nare subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are\ntraded in the open market.

Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due\nto the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities,\nthe liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar\nrated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of\nthe scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher\nimpact cost when such instruments are sold.\n\n  - **Credit Risk:** The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the\n\ncombined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the\nissuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The\nweakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure\ndue to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce\nguarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases\nthe overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions.

However, if the corporate does not exercise the\ncall option, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call\nexercise date.\n\n\n**(xii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling**\n\nShort-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade.\nInstead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the\nstock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects,\nShort seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the\ndifference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock\n\n\n**13**\n\n\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\n\n\nappreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money\nand these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall\nresult into major losses in the portfolio.\n\n\n**(xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:**\n\n- **Price Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a\ndaily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in\ngeneral market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and\nInfrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer\nprocedures.\n\n- **Interest Rate Risk:**\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates\nrise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n\n- **Credit Risk:**\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest\npayment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of\nREITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not\nnecessarily be pre scheduled.",

    "text": "- **Liquidity Risk:**\nThis refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is\nno assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there\nwould be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of\nilliquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments\nfor which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be\nexposed to liquidity risk.\n\n- **Reinvestment Risk:**\nInvestments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there\ncould be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay-outs,\netc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns.\n\n- **Legal and Regulatory Risk**\nThe regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs\ncomprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and\nenforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast\nas to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers\nof REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the\nregulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply\nwith the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions.\n\n**(xiv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities**\n\nIn repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with\n\nthe seller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than\nthe original sale price, the difference effectively representing interest. A repo in corporate debt\nsecurities is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt\n\n\n**14**\n\n\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM",

    "text": "**Collateral Risk** : Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to\n\nmeet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo\ntransactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally,\nto address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral\ndue to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the\nrepo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for\nreplacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a\nhigher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the\nilliquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction\ndue to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by\nconsidering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the\nexchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified\nperiod. If the counterparty is not able to top-up either in form of cash / collateral, it would\ntantamount to early termination of the repo agreement, and the outstanding amount can be\nrecovered by sale of collateral.\n\n**(xv) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes**\n\n\n1.

The risk control\nprocess involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this\ndiversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use\nvarious derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time,\nwith an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest.

Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable\nmeasure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage\nand transaction cost.",

Delays or other problems\nin settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are\nuninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities\npurchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment\nopportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the\nabsence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in\npotential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in\nthe Scheme's portfolio.\n\n- Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income\n\nsecurity. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest\nrates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing\ncoupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of\ninterest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels\nat which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government\nSecurities. It exists for all fixed income securities.

Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are\ncomparatively less risky than AA rated bonds.\n\n- The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated\n\nsecurities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may\nincrease the absolute level of risk of the portfolio.\n\n- As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these\n\nsecurities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk.\nTherefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in\nzero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero\ncoupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic\npayment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current\ninterest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount\ndepends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest.\nIt also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived\ncredit risk of the Issuer.

This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in\ncorporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to\nreduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the\nrepo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to\nmeet the minimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security. Moreover,\nthe investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security than required as per\nRBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To\nmitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be\nmonitored on a daily basis by considering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The\nfund manager or the exchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a\nprespecified period.

Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs),\nthe proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling\n\n\n**40**\n\n\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\n\n\nhis loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the maturity of the\nunderlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from borrowers. Typically,\nthe transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit enhancement (as stipulated by the rating agency\nfor a target rating), which provides protection to investors against defaults by the underlying borrowers.\nGenerally available asset classes for securitisation in India are:\n\n  - Commercial vehicles\n\n  - Auto and two wheeler pools\n\n  - Mortgage pools (residential housing loans)\n\n  - Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans\n\n  - Corporate loans/receivables\n**Investment / Risk Mitigation Strategy**\n**1. Risk profile of securitised debt vis-à-vis risk appetite of the Scheme**\nThe risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at the\nsame level of credit rating. Securitised debt offers additional income (spread) over a debt security of\nsimilar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any additional\ncredit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investment in securitised debt is made to\nmaintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing the overall risk\nprofile of the Scheme.\n\n**2.

Changes in financial\nconditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes\nin economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that\nmay have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may\nincrease the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit\nrisk through in-house credit analysis.\n\n- **Prepayment Risk:** Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its\n\nsecurities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of\nsuch prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in\nsecurities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n\n- **Reinvestment Risk:** This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received\n\nfrom the securities in the Scheme are reinvested.

Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall\nand when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a\nfunction of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level\nof interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which\ngovernment raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already\ndealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government Securities. It\nexists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the\nsense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced\nonly by movement in interest rates in the financial system.\n\n - Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the",

Accordingly, the\nScheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g.\ncorporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even\namong corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated\nbonds.\n\n - The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated /\n\nunrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer\nattractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio.\n\n - As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the\n\nsecurity, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to\nissuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The\nAMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may\nincrease the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations\nthat do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a\nspecified date when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are\ngenerally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the\ntime remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It\nalso varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the\nperceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are\ngenerally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.\n\n - **Backstop facility in the form of investment in Corporate Debt Market Development**",

    "text": "**(viii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling**\n\nShort-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade.\nInstead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the\nstock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects,\nShort seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the\ndifference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock\nappreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money\nand these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall\nresult into major losses in the portfolio.\n\n\n**(ix) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities**\n\nIn repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with\n\nthe seller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than\nthe original sale price, the difference effectively representing interest. A repo in corporate debt\nsecurities is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt\nsecurities as collateral to protect against default. Some of the risks associated with repo in\ncorporate debt are given below:\n\n\n**11**\n\n\nHDFC Liquid Fund - KIM\n\n\n**Counterparty Risk** : Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to",

This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo\ntransactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally,\nto address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral\ndue to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the\nrepo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for\nreplacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a\nhigher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the\nilliquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction\ndue to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by\nconsidering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the\nexchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified\nperiod.

The NAV of the\nScheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected\nby an increase in the level of interest rates.\n\n- Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may\n\nrestrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the\nsecurity is finally sold.\n\n- Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating\n\nof the issuers.\n\n- Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk\n\nof an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues,\nwhich may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer,\nchanges in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political\nconditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an\nissuer's credit quality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The\nInvestment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis.\n\n- **Prepayment Risk:** Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its\n\nsecurities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such\nprepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities\noffering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n\n- **Reinvestment Risk:** This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from",

The additional income from reinvestment is the\n\"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be\nreinvested may be lower than that originally assumed.\n\n- **Settlement risk:** Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods\n\nand such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other\nproblems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the\nScheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make\nintended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss\ncertain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's\nportfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities,\nmay result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the\nvalue of securities held in the Scheme's portfolio.\n\n- Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income\n\nsecurity.

While government bonds, money market\ninstruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other\ninstruments typically face higher liquidity risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid\n\n\n**34**\n\n\nHDFC Liquid Fund-SID\n\n\ncompared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity\nrisk based on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are\ncreating portfolios that are diversified across maturities, ratings, types of securities, etc. in line with\nthe fund objectives, regulations and investment strategy.\n\n**Credit Risk:** Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities.\n\nHence, credit risk faced by different schemes will be different based on the underlying portfolio /\ninvestment strategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of\neach issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.)\nand qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Each of the scheme/portfolio will endeavour to\nmaintain adequate diversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations\nand investment strategy.

Investors are issued rated Pass Through\nCertificates (PTCs), the proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner,\nthe originator, by selling his loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much\nbefore the maturity of the underlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying\nloans from borrowers. Typically, the transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit\nenhancement (as stipulated by the rating agency for a target rating), which provides protection to\ninvestors against defaults by the underlying borrowers.\nGenerally available asset classes for securitisation in India are:\n\n  - Commercial vehicles\n\n  - Auto and two wheeler pools\n\n  - Mortgage pools (residential housing loans)\n\n  - Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans\n\n  - Corporate loans/receivables\n**Investment / Risk Mitigation Strategy**\n**1. Risk profile of securitised debt vis-à-vis risk appetite of the Scheme**\nThe risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at\nthe same level of credit rating. Securitised debt offers additional income (spread) over a debt security\nof similar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any\nadditional credit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investment in securitised debt\nis made to maintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing\nthe overall risk profile of the Scheme.\n\n**2.

Changes in financial\nconditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes\nin economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that\nmay have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values.

The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit\nrisk through in-house credit analysis.\n\n- **Prepayment Risk:** Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its\n\nsecurities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of\nsuch prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in\nsecurities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n\n- **Reinvestment Risk:** This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received\n\nfrom the securities in the Scheme are reinvested.

The\ninability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems,\ncould cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities.

Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall\nand when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a\nfunction of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level\nof interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which\ngovernment raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already\ndealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government Securities. It\nexists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the\nsense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced\nonly by movement in interest rates in the financial system.\n\n - Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the",

    "text": "- Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the\n\nScheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the\nScheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g.\ncorporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even\namong corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated\nbonds.\n\n - The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated /\n\nunrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer\nattractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio.\n\n - As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the\n\nsecurity, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to\nissuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The\nAMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may\nincrease the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations\nthat do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a\nspecified date when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are\ngenerally issued and traded at a discount to their face values.

The NAV of the\nScheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected\nby an increase in the level of interest rates.\n\n- Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may\n\nrestrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the\nsecurity is finally sold.\n\n- Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating\n\nof the issuers.\n\n- Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk\n\nof an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues,\nwhich may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer,\nchanges in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political\nconditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an\nissuer's credit quality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The\nInvestment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis.\n\n- **Prepayment Risk:** Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its\n\nsecurities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such\nprepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities\noffering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n\n- **Reinvestment Risk:** This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from",

The additional income from reinvestment is the\n\"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be\nreinvested may be lower than that originally assumed.\n\n- **Settlement risk:** Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods\n\nand such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other\nproblems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the\nScheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make\nintended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss\ncertain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's\nportfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities,\nmay result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the\nvalue of securities held in the Scheme's portfolio.\n\n- Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income\n\nsecurity.

Post utilization\nof CCIL's contribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions\nof the non-defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default\nfund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In addition, the\nfund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing\nmember (the defaulting member).",

The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the\nunderlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper\nvaluation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and\nindices.\n\n- Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as\n\ndisproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the\nfund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be\npursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be\nprofitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such\nstrategies.\n\n- The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks\n\nassociated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.",
